# Multi Objective Optimization - Knapsack 0/1

## Introduction:

This project presents a few implementations of the multi objective problem: Knapsack 0/1.

The approches are:
1. Brute Force
2. Branch and Bound
3. Hill Climbing

In each implementation the output contatins the list of chosen items, total weight, total value and duration.

In our project we investigated the diffrences between the approches and present the advantages and disadvanteges of them, as you can see at the following graph below:
