# Multi Objective Optimization - Knapsack 0/1

## Introduction:

This project presents a few implementations of the multi objective problem: Knapsack 0/1. 

The approaches are: 
1. Brute Force 
2. Branch and Bound 
3. Hill Climbing 

In each implementation the output contains the list of chosen items, total weight, total value, and duration. 

In our project we investigated the differences between the approaches and present the advantages and disadvantages of them, as you can see at the following graph below:
